# AgriFin

## Description

A financial management tool tailored to help small farmers and local agricultural businesses manage costs and track sustainable practices. In this website, users can add in financial transactions related to their farming business. Each transaction allows users to input details about it and its impact on the environment. After inputting their transactions, users can analyze their activities and sustainability practices through easy to understand graphs and charts.

This website is deployed on the web with Render at [AgriFin](https://argifin-chb5.onrender.com). We used the free hobby version of Render, so the website will take a few minutes to load initially.
